/**
 * Order FSM — canonical transitions for Order.status (not to be confused with
 * Order.payment.status, which has its own FSM; see orderPaymentFsm.ts).
 *
 * States (11 total) mirror Order.ts in rezbackend:
 *   placed → confirmed → preparing → ready → dispatched → out_for_delivery → delivered
 *   any pre-delivered state can move to `cancelling` → `cancelled`
 *   delivered can move to `returned` or `refunded`
 *
 * This FSM is enforced at the API boundary (merchant app -> backend) and in
 * the broadcast subscribers that react to order events.
