/**
 * Payment FSM — canonical state-machine rules for the Payment entity.
 *
 * Mirrors rezbackend/src/config/financialStateMachine.ts (PAYMENT_TRANSITIONS)
 * so every service, the merchant app, and the consumer app agree on the same
 * graph. This is the single source of truth: update THIS file first, then
 * regenerate the backend copy.
 *
 * The graph covers the full 11-state lifecycle:
 *   pending → processing → completed → refund_initiated → refund_processing
 *     → refunded (terminal) | partially_refunded (can re-refund)
 *   any state → cancelled | expired | failed as allowed below
 *
 * Only transitions whose `from` key appears here with `to` in the value list
 * are legal. Callers MUST route every status mutation through
 * `assertValidPaymentTransition()` so invalid changes surface as errors rather
 * than silent inconsistency.

 * The only canonical difference: `partially_refunded` is a real post-refund
