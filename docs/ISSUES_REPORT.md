### OPS-001: Intent Graph is Not Production-Grade

**Severity:** P0 — Critical
**Type:** OPS + STRAT
**Owner:** Platform Team / ML Engineering

**Issue:**
The Intent Graph (`rez-intent-graph`) is a Flask app deployed on Render's free tier. It has no:
- Vector database (pgvector / Pinecone / Qdrant) for embedding similarity search
- Real-time signal ingestion pipeline (Kafka / Redis Streams)
- Redis-backed caching layer
- Horizontal scaling configuration
- A/B testing framework for recommendation models
- Observability / monitoring

**Impact:**
- The Intent Graph is described as the AI moat of the ecosystem — "users who booked X also ordered Y"
- If this service fails or is slow, cross-app personalization breaks silently
- It is queried on every page load across REZ Now, Hotel OTA, Rendez
- A single Flask instance on Render free tier cannot handle production QPS

**Root Cause:**
Built as a proof-of-concept, never productionized.

**Resolution Required:**
1. Add Redis Streams for real-time intent signal ingestion
2. Add pgvector extension on a PostgreSQL database for embedding storage and similarity search
3. Add API response caching (Redis, 5-minute TTL)
4. Deploy on a scalable platform (Render Starter minimum, or self-hosted with Gunicorn + multiple workers)
5. Add Prometheus metrics endpoint for observability
6. Implement a circuit breaker — if Intent Graph is slow/down, consumer apps should degrade gracefully (show non-personalized results)
7. Define a data model: what signals are captured, how embeddings are generated, how recommendations are scored

**Effort:** 3-4 weeks

### OPS-002: No Redis Adapter for Socket.io

**Severity:** P0 — Critical
**Type:** OPS
**Owner:** Hotel OTA Team + Rendez Team

**Issue:**
Hotel OTA uses Socket.io for real-time booking status updates. There is no Redis adapter configured. Socket.io requires a Redis adapter for multi-instance deployments — without it, only the instance that received the event can broadcast it to connected clients.

**Impact:**
- **Production silent failure:** Two or more Render instances behind a load balancer. A booking created on instance 1 generates a Socket.io event. Instance 2 never receives it. Hotel staff connected to instance 2 sees stale booking data. They accept a room that was already assigned.
- Real-time updates are a core feature of the Hotel PMS dashboard.

**Root Cause:**
Socket.io was implemented with default configuration, Redis adapter was never added.

**Resolution Required:**
```typescript
// Install
npm install @socket.io/redis-adapter

// In server setup
import { createAdapter } from '@socket.io/redis-adapter';
import { redis } from './config/redis';

const pubClient = redis.duplicate();
const subClient = redis.duplicate();
io.adapter(createAdapter(pubClient, subClient));
```

**Effort:** 1-2 days

**STATUS: RESOLVED (2026-04-29)**

- **Hotel OTA API** — Redis adapter was already configured in `src/socket/hotelSocket.ts` (lines 107-117). The `pubClient` and `subClient` are created via `redis.duplicate()` and the adapter is set on the Socket.io server. `@socket.io/redis-adapter` is already in dependencies.
- **Rendez Backend** — Added `@socket.io/redis-adapter` to `package.json`. Updated `src/config/redis.ts` to set `maxRetriesPerRequest: null` (required for Socket.io adapter). Updated `src/realtime/socketServer.ts` to import and configure the Redis adapter.
- **Health checks** — Added `/health/socket` endpoint to both Hotel OTA API (`src/index.ts`) and Rendez Backend (`src/index.ts`) to verify Redis adapter connectivity.
- **CI/CD** — Added Redis service to Rendez Backend CI/CD test job. Added `REDIS_URL` to CI environment variables.

### OPS-003: No API Gateway

**Severity:** P0 — Critical
**Type:** OPS + SEC
**Owner:** Platform Team

**Issue:**
Services call each other directly via environment variables:
```
REZ_MERCHANT_SERVICE_URL
REZ_WALLET_SERVICE_URL
REZ_PAYMENT_SERVICE_URL
REZ_AUTH_SERVICE_URL
```

Every service handles authentication, rate limiting, logging, and routing independently. There is no centralized entry point.

**Impact:**
- **Security:** No centralized auth validation. If one service has a broken auth check, every service it can reach is exposed.
- **No rate limiting per consumer.** A bad actor with one API key can hammer any downstream service.
- **No circuit breakers.** A slow Wallet Service degrades Merchant Service, which degrades Hotel OTA — all silently.
- **No request logging/auditing.** No visibility into what services are calling what.
- **No API versioning.** Changes to internal APIs break consumer apps with no coordination.
- **No DDoS protection at the edge.** Render and Vercel provide basic protection, insufficient for a financial app.

**Root Cause:**
Services were built incrementally without a platform layer.

**Resolution Required:**
1. Deploy Kong API Gateway (self-hosted or managed) or AWS API Gateway
2. All external traffic enters through the gateway
3. Gateway handles: JWT validation, rate limiting (per API key + per endpoint), request logging, circuit breaking (via Kong plugin or AWS), CORS enforcement
4. Internal service-to-service calls can bypass gateway for performance, but must still have mTLS or internal token validation
5. Register all API routes in the gateway with versioning

**Effort:** 4-6 weeks

---

### OPS-004: No CI/CD Pipeline

**Severity:** P0 — Critical
**Type:** OPS
**Owner:** DevOps / Platform Team

**Issue:**
No described:
- Automated build pipeline per service
- Automated test execution (unit, integration)
- Canary deployment strategy
- Automated rollback on failure
- Feature flags
- Environment parity (dev, staging, prod)
- Docker image building

**Impact:**
- **Deployment risk:** A broken commit to `rez-merchant-service` can silently break Hotel OTA's merchant lookups. No alerts, no rollbacks.
- **No staging parity:** Developers push directly to Render/Vercel. Bugs are found in production.
- **No rollback capability:** If a bad deploy reaches 100% of traffic, the only recovery is to push another fix — which takes time and still needs review.
- **With 8+ services across 3+ hosting providers:** Manual deployment of each service is error-prone and time-consuming.

**Root Cause:**
Built fast to ship. Pipeline was deferred.

**Resolution Required:**
1. Add `Dockerfile` to every service
2. Add `docker-compose.yml` for local development parity
3. Add GitHub Actions workflow per service:
   ```
   push → lint → typecheck → unit tests → build → e2e tests → build image → deploy staging → smoke tests → canary deploy (10%) → full deploy
   ```
4. Implement canary deployment: 10% → 50% → 100% with automatic health check between stages
5. Auto-rollback on: error rate spike > 5%, latency increase > 200ms, health check failures > 3
6. Add Sentry source maps for production error debugging

**Effort:** 4-6 weeks (one-time setup, then incremental per service)

**STATUS: RESOLVED (2026-04-29)**

Implemented the following:

**Remaining work (OPS-004 related):**
- Canary deployment (10% → 50% → 100%) — not yet implemented; requires Render Blueprints or manual traffic splitting
- Auto-rollback on error rate spike — not yet implemented; requires Prometheus alerting + Render webhook
- Sentry source maps — already handled by Sentry SDK initialization in each service

### SEC-001: No Token Rotation on OAuth2 Refresh

**Severity:** P0 — Critical
**Type:** SEC
**Owner:** Auth Service Team

**Issue:**
The OAuth2 implementation issues a refresh token that can be reused indefinitely. There is no **refresh token rotation** — the standard security practice where:
1. A new access token is issued
2. A new refresh token is also issued (replacing the old one)
3. The old refresh token is immediately invalidated

**Impact:**
- If a refresh token is leaked (logs, man-in-the-middle), an attacker can get long-term access to the user's account
- No described token reuse detection (if a rotated refresh token is used again, it's a theft signal)
- Critical for financial apps where the wallet is involved

**Root Cause:**
Refresh token rotation was not implemented in the initial OAuth2 flow.

**Resolution Required:**
1. On every `/oauth/refresh` call, generate and return a new `refresh_token`
2. Store the hash of the current valid refresh token (already done: `refreshTokenHash`)
3. On refresh, invalidate the old hash and store the new one
4. Detect token reuse: if a refresh token is used twice, revoke the entire token family and force re-authentication
5. Add `token_type: "refresh"` and `expires_in` to refresh token responses

**Effort:** 1-2 weeks

### SEC-002: No Described WAF / DDoS Protection

**Severity:** P0 — Critical
**Type:** SEC
**Owner:** DevOps / Platform Team

**Issue:**
No Web Application Firewall is described. No DDoS mitigation layer. Render and Vercel provide basic protection but:
- They are not specialized WAFs
- They have rate limits but no intelligent threat detection
- They do not provide OWASP Top 10 protection out of the box
- For a financial super-app handling real money, this is insufficient

**Impact:**
- OWASP Top 10 attacks (SQL injection, XSS, broken auth, sensitive data exposure) are not mitigated at the edge
- Volumetric DDoS attacks can overwhelm Render/Vercel limits
- No bot protection — credential stuffing attacks on the auth endpoints are possible

**Root Cause:**
Security was not considered in the initial hosting decisions.

**Resolution Required:**
1. Deploy Cloudflare (free tier minimum, Pro for financial apps) in front of all public endpoints
2. Enable Cloudflare WAF rules for OWASP Top 10
3. Enable bot management / Super Bot Fight Mode
4. Configure rate limiting rules at Cloudflare level (100 req/min per IP for auth endpoints)
5. Enable DDoS protection (automatic on Cloudflare Pro+)
6. Set up Cloudflare Workers for intelligent routing and challenge

**Effort:** 1-2 days (setup) + ongoing tuning

**STATUS: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT (2026-04-29)**

- XSS (script tags, event handlers, javascript: URIs, SVG injection)
- Path traversal (Unix, Windows, null bytes)
- Command injection (shell metacharacters)
- HTTP smuggling (CL:0, Transfer-Encoding)
- Known bot tools (curl, wget, SQLmap, Nmap, Burp, etc.)
- High-confidence bot scores (Cloudflare Bot Management)
- Empty User-Agent
- Requests from blocked countries

**Remaining setup (1-2 days):**
1. Create Cloudflare API token (follow `docs/CLOUDFLARE_SETUP.md`)
2. Add `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` to GitHub Secrets
3. Deploy Worker: `cd cloudflare/waf-workers/api-gateway && npm run deploy`
4. Configure DNS routes in Cloudflare Dashboard
5. Enable Bot Management and WAF rules in Cloudflare Dashboard

### TECH-001: Single MongoDB Node (No Replica Set)

**Severity:** P0 — Critical
**Type:** TECH + OPS
**Owner:** DevOps / Platform Team

**Issue:**
MongoDB is used for Auth Service, Merchant Service, and Hotel OTA. There is no described replica set configuration. A single MongoDB node is:
- A single point of failure — if it crashes, all three services go down
- No high availability — no automatic failover
- No read replicas for reporting/analytics queries (they hit the primary)
- No data durability guarantee beyond the single node's disk

**Impact:**
- MongoDB crash = complete ecosystem outage (all auth, all merchant data, all hotel bookings)
- No read replica means reporting queries compete with production traffic

**Root Cause:**
Default MongoDB setup was used. Replica set requires additional infrastructure.

**Resolution Required:**
1. Configure MongoDB replica set: 1 primary + 2 secondary + 1 arbiter (minimum 4 nodes)
2. Use MongoDB Atlas (managed) or self-hosted with proper replica set config
3. Configure read preference for analytics queries to use secondary nodes
4. Set up MongoDB Atlas backup (or self-hosted `mongodump` cron)
5. Document and test failover procedure

**Effort:** 1-2 weeks

**STATUS: CODE COMPLETE (2026-04-30)**

MongoDB Atlas is already configured (cluster: `cluster0.ku78x6g.mongodb.net`). Atlas uses replica sets internally by default, so no additional setup is needed for production.

Changes made:

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `docker-compose.yml` | Updated to 3-node replica set (primary + 2 secondary) with proper health checks |
| `docker-compose.example.env` | Added replica set URI format and read preference options |
| `rez-auth-service/src/config/mongodb.ts` | Added replica set support, read preference, auth source, reconnection logging |
| `rez-merchant-service/src/config/mongodb.ts` | Added replica set support, read preference, auth source, reconnection logging |

**Local Development Setup:**
```bash
# Start MongoDB replica set
docker compose up -d mongodb-primary mongodb-secondary-1 mongodb-secondary-2 mongodb-init

# Connection URI for services
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017,localhost:27018,localhost:27019/rez_dev?replicaSet=rs0

# For analytics/reporting (read from secondary)
MONGODB_READ_PREFERENCE=secondary
```

**Manual verification required:**
1. Verify MongoDB Atlas backup is configured (Atlas Dashboard → Backups)
2. Test failover by checking Atlas replica set status
3. Verify `MONGODB_URI` in Render dashboard includes `?replicaSet=` parameter
4. Document failover runbook

### STRAT-001: No Revenue Model Documented

**Severity:** P0 — Critical
**Type:** BIZ + STRAT
**Owner:** Business / Product Team

**Issue:**
The codebase does not describe how REZ makes money. There is no visible:
- Commission rate on wallet transfers
- Markup or fee on hotel bookings
- Subscription pricing for NextaBiZ
- Transaction fee on merchant payments
- White-label licensing for partners

**Impact:**
- **For investors:** Cannot model unit economics, LTV, or ROI
- **For business owners:** No clarity on cost — what does REZ charge? Is it per-transaction or monthly?
- **For the team:** No revenue targets to optimize toward, no pricing experiments possible

**Root Cause:**
Business model was not formalized or codified.

**Resolution Required:**
1. Define and document the revenue model: commission rate, subscription tiers, transaction fees
2. Add a monetization service that records every transaction and calculates REZ's take
3. Add a billing/invoice system for merchant subscriptions
4. Instrument the codebase with revenue metrics (amount of GMV, REZ's take per transaction)
5. Build a merchant-facing pricing page

**Effort:** 2-3 weeks (depends on business decision)

## P1 — High (Fix Within 90 Days)

---

### OPS-005: Single Redis Instance (No HA)

**Severity:** P1 — High
**Type:** OPS
**Owner:** DevOps / Platform Team

**Issue:**
Redis is used for sessions, OAuth state, Socket.io pub/sub, caching, and rate limiting across all services. A single Redis instance means:
- Redis down = all users logged out simultaneously
- Session loss = all active sessions invalidated
- No HA = no automatic failover

**Impact:**
- Redis crash = complete authentication outage across the entire ecosystem
- All Socket.io connections drop
- All rate limiting resets (potential for a burst attack immediately after)

**Resolution Required:**
1. Deploy Redis Sentinel for automatic failover (1 primary + 2 replicas + 3 sentinels)
   OR
2. Use Redis Cluster for horizontal sharding (if session volume is high)
3. Use Redis AUTH and TLS in production
4. Test failover procedure

**Effort:** 1-2 weeks

---

### OPS-006: No Observability Stack

**Severity:** P1 — High
**Type:** OPS
**Owner:** DevOps / Platform Team

**Issue:**
No described observability infrastructure:
- No metrics (Prometheus, Datadog)
- No distributed tracing (Jaeger, Zipkin)
- No centralized logging (Grafana Loki, ELK)
- No alerting (PagerDuty, OpsGenie)
- No uptime monitoring (no described external monitoring)

**Impact:**
- Production incidents are discovered by users, not by monitoring
- No way to correlate errors across services (which service failed first?)
- No SLA visibility — don't know if we're meeting uptime commitments
- No performance profiling — slow endpoints are invisible

**Resolution Required:**
1. Deploy Grafana + Prometheus (self-hosted or Grafana Cloud)
2. Add Prometheus metrics endpoint (`/metrics`) to every service
3. Deploy Loki for log aggregation (replace console.log with structured JSON logs)
4. Add OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing
5. Set up alerts: error rate > 1%, latency p99 > 2s, pod restarts > 3 in 10 min
6. Configure PagerDuty for on-call rotation

**Effort:** 3-4 weeks

---

### SEC-003: No Centralized Input Validation

**Severity:** P1 — High
**Type:** SEC + TECH
**Owner:** All Service Teams

**Issue:**
Input validation is implemented per-route, inconsistently. No centralized validation framework (Zod, Joi, class-validator) is enforced across services.

**Impact:**
- Risk of injection attacks (SQL, NoSQL) if a developer forgets to sanitize a query parameter
- Risk of malformed data entering the system
- Inconsistent error responses across endpoints
- Harder to audit validation coverage

**Resolution Required:**
1. Adopt Zod as the standard validation library across all services
2. Define shared validation schemas in `rez-shared/validation`
3. Add a middleware that validates request body, query params, and headers against the schema
4. Enforce via linting rule: no `req.body` access without prior validation middleware
5. Generate TypeScript types from Zod schemas for end-to-end type safety

**Effort:** 2-3 weeks (includes schema definition + middleware + migration)

---

### SEC-004: No KYC/AML Flow for Wallet Users

**Severity:** P1 — High
**Type:** SEC + BIZ
**Owner:** Wallet Service Team + Legal

**Issue:**
REZ Wallet holds real money and allows wallet-to-wallet transfers. There is no described KYC (Know Your Customer) or AML (Anti-Money Laundering) compliance flow:
- Any phone number can create a wallet
- No identity verification
- No transaction limits based on KYC tier
- No transaction monitoring for suspicious activity
- No SAR (Suspicious Activity Report) mechanism

**Impact:**
- **Regulatory risk:** Most jurisdictions require KYC for digital wallets holding significant balances
- **Legal risk:** Without AML controls, REZ could be used for money laundering
- **Financial risk:** A fraudulent wallet can receive and transfer stolen funds

**Resolution Required:**
1. Define KYC tiers: Level 1 (phone only, low limits), Level 2 (ID verification, higher limits), Level 3 (full KYC, unlimited)
2. Integrate a KYC provider (Jumio, Onfido, or Indian-specific: Aadhaar eKYC)
3. Implement transaction monitoring: velocity limits, pattern detection
4. Add SAR workflow: flag suspicious transactions, require manual review
5. Set up transaction limits per KYC tier
6. Document the compliance posture for legal review

**Effort:** 4-8 weeks + legal review

---

### TECH-002: Hotel OTA — Unbounded Queries

**Severity:** P1 — High
**Type:** TECH
**Owner:** Hotel OTA Team

**Issue:**
Hotel OTA API has 168 routes. While Hotel PMS mandates server-side pagination, the Hotel OTA API itself has not been fully audited for:
- Unbounded `.find()` on bookings, rooms, guests collections
- Missing `.limit()` defaults on list endpoints
- Missing `.lean()` on read-only queries (memory overhead)

**Impact:**
- If a collection has millions of records, an unbounded query will exhaust memory and crash the service
- Reporting queries hitting the primary MongoDB node slow down production traffic

**Resolution Required:**
1. Audit all list endpoints in Hotel OTA API for pagination
2. Enforce default pagination: `page=1, limit=20, maxLimit=100`
3. Add `.lean()` to all read-only queries
4. Create MongoDB indexes on commonly filtered fields (hotelId, date ranges, status)
5. Add a linting rule: reject any `.find()` without a `.limit()` in tests

**Effort:** 1-2 weeks (audit) + 2-3 weeks (fixes)

---

### TECH-003: Rendez PostgreSQL — No Connection Pooling

**Severity:** P1 — High
**Type:** TECH
**Owner:** Rendez Team

**Issue:**
Rendez uses Prisma with PostgreSQL. Default Prisma connection pool size is 5 connections. Under production load:
- Connection exhaustion → queries fail with "too many connections"
- No connection pooling layer (PgBouncer) described

**Impact:**
- Database connection errors under load (especially during peak hours)
- Random 500 errors that are hard to debug

**Resolution Required:**
1. Add PgBouncer in transaction mode between Prisma and PostgreSQL
2. Configure PgBouncer: `pool_size = 20`, `max_client_conn = 100`
3. Set Prisma's `connection_limit` to match PgBouncer pool size
4. Monitor connection usage with `pgbouncer show pools`

**Effort:** 1-2 days

---

### TECH-004: Hotel OTA Module Structure is Flat

**Severity:** P1 — High
**Type:** TECH
**Owner:** Hotel OTA Team

**Issue:**
Hotel OTA API has 168 routes, 108 controllers, 164 services in a flat MVC structure. This creates:
- No domain boundaries — bookings, rooms, guests, payments all mixed
- No clear dependency graph — everything calls everything
- Hard to onboard new engineers
- High coupling — changing one domain breaks others

**Resolution Required:**
1. Refactor into domain-based modules:
   ```
   src/
     modules/
       bookings/
         routes.ts, controllers/, services/, models/
       rooms/
         routes.ts, controllers/, services/, models/
       payments/
         routes.ts, controllers/, services/, models/
       guests/
         routes.ts, controllers/, services/, models/
     shared/
       middleware/, utils/, errors/, validators/
   ```
2. Define module boundaries — each module exposes a clean API
3. Cross-module calls go through the module API, not internal functions
4. Add integration tests per module
5. This is a medium-term refactor — do it alongside feature work, not as a standalone project

**Effort:** 8-12 weeks (gradual migration)

---

### TECH-005: Hotel PMS Frontend — Bundle Size / Performance

**Severity:** P1 — High
**Type:** TECH
**Owner:** Hotel PMS Team

**Issue:**
Hotel PMS frontend has 200 pages, 423 components in a single React app. No described:
- Code splitting / lazy loading per route
- Bundle size measurement
- Tree shaking optimization
- Performance budgets
- Image optimization pipeline

**Impact:**
- Slow initial load time (especially on hotel staff tablets with slow connections)
- Large JS bundle = slow Time to Interactive
- Hard to maintain tree shaking discipline at scale

**Resolution Required:**
1. Add lazy loading per route:
   ```typescript
   const BookingsPage = lazy(() => import('./pages/BookingsPage'));
   ```
2. Add `React.Suspense` fallback with skeleton loaders
3. Run `webpack-bundle-analyzer` to identify large dependencies
4. Set performance budget: initial JS bundle < 250KB gzipped
5. Implement image optimization (next/image or a dedicated CDN)
6. Add route-based code splitting at the router level

**Effort:** 2-3 weeks

---

### TECH-006: Two Separate Hotel Frontends

**Severity:** P1 — High
**Type:** TECH + OPS
**Owner:** Hotel OTA Team

**Issue:**
Two separate frontend codebases for hotel management:
- `hotel-panel` — Next.js (owner dashboard)
- `hotel-pms` — React/Vite (staff management)

Significant overlap exists: shared UI components (buttons, cards, tables, forms), shared auth flows, shared booking views.

**Impact:**
- Code duplication — same components written twice
- Inconsistent UI — slight differences between panel and PMS
- Twice the maintenance overhead

**Resolution Required:**
1. Extract shared UI components into `@rez/rez-ui` package
2. Use `rez-ui` in both `hotel-panel` and `hotel-pms`
3. Define a shared design system (tokens, spacing, typography, colors)
4. Keep domain-specific components in each app
5. Document shared component usage in both CLAUDE.md files

**Effort:** 3-4 weeks

---

### BIZ-001: Manual OAuth2 Partner Registration

**Severity:** P1 — High
**Type:** BIZ + OPS
**Owner:** Platform Team

**Issue:**
Adding a new OAuth2 partner requires a developer to manually:
1. Update `oauthPartnerRoutes.ts` in REZ Auth Service with partner credentials
2. Add env vars to the partner app
3. Coordinate with the partner team on redirect URI
4. Test the flow manually

For 6 partners this is manageable. For 60, it is unmanageable.

**Impact:**
- Partner onboarding takes days instead of minutes
- No self-service — partners depend on the REZ platform team
- No automatic testing of partner OAuth2 flows
- Blocks ecosystem scaling

**Resolution Required:**
1. Build a Partner Portal (internal or external) with:
   - Self-service partner registration form
   - Automatic OAuth2 client credential generation
   - Redirect URI validation and registration
   - Scope negotiation and approval workflow
   - Test OAuth2 flow in the portal
2. Add a `partners` table in the Auth Service database
3. Move partner config out of env vars and into the database
4. Add an admin API for partner management

### OPS-007: No Staging / Dev Environment Parity

**Severity:** P2 — Medium
**Type:** OPS
**Owner:** DevOps / Platform Team

**Issue:**
No described staging environment. Developers push directly to production hosting (Render, Vercel). Features are tested manually or in production.

**Impact:**
- Bugs reach production
- No way to test integrations between services before release
- No place to run E2E tests in CI

**Resolution Required:**
1. Create a `staging` environment for every service (Render has auto-scaling, can run staging alongside prod)
2. Use `docker-compose.yml` for local full-stack development
3. Add staging environment to GitHub Actions pipeline (deploy to staging → run E2E → deploy to prod)
4. Staging should use real services (Auth, Wallet) but isolated data

**Effort:** 2-3 weeks

### OPS-008: No Described SLA / SLO

**Severity:** P2 — Medium
**Type:** BIZ + OPS
**Owner:** Business / Platform Team

**Issue:**
No documented uptime commitments, incident response plan, or customer-facing SLA.

**Impact:**
- No accountability framework for service reliability
- No baseline to measure improvement
- Business cannot promise uptime to enterprise customers

**Resolution Required:**
1. Define SLOs per service:
   - Auth Service: 99.9% uptime (52 min downtime/year max)
   - Wallet Service: 99.95% uptime (26 min downtime/year max)
   - Other services: 99.5% uptime
2. Document error budget policy (if error budget < 50%, no risky deploys)
3. Create an incident response playbook: severity levels, escalation path, communication template
4. Publish status page (Statuspage.io or similar)

**Effort:** 1 week (documentation) + ongoing

### SEC-005: No Multi-Factor Authentication for Users

**Severity:** P2 — Medium
**Type:** SEC
**Owner:** Auth Service Team

**Issue:**
Users authenticate with phone + OTP. No MFA options:
- No TOTP (authenticator app like Google Authenticator)
- No SMS backup codes
- No WebAuthn / passkeys

**Impact:**
- If OTP is intercepted (SIM swap, SMS interception), account is compromised
- No additional security layer for high-value actions (wallet transactions above a threshold)
- Below industry standard for financial apps

**Resolution Required:**
1. Add TOTP support (speakeasy or otplib library):
   - User enables MFA in profile settings
   - Generates QR code for authenticator app setup
   - Stores encrypted TOTP secret in database
   - Validates TOTP code on login
2. Add MFA requirement for wallet transactions above ₹10,000
3. Add backup codes (one-time codes for account recovery)
4. Consider WebAuthn/passkeys as a future option

**Effort:** 2-3 weeks

### SEC-006: No Described PCI-DSS Compliance

**Severity:** P2 — Medium
**Type:** SEC + BIZ
**Owner:** Payment Service Team + Legal

**Issue:**
Hotel OTA handles payment card data via Razorpay. The code does not describe:
- PCI-DSS scope (is REZ in scope or is Razorpay the merchant of record?)
- How card data flows through the system
- Data retention policy for payment records
- Encryption standards for stored payment metadata

**Impact:**
- Regulatory risk if card data is mishandled
- Cannot sell to enterprise customers without compliance documentation
- Potential liability if a data breach occurs

**Resolution Required:**
1. Determine PCI-DSS scope: if using Razorpay's hosted checkout (tokenized), REZ may be out of PCI scope
2. If in scope: engage a QSA (Qualified Security Assessor) for compliance review
3. Add data retention policy: delete payment records after X years
4. Add PCI-DSS compliance documentation for enterprise sales

**Effort:** 2-4 weeks + legal review

### TECH-007: NextaBiZ — Duplicate Merchant on OAuth2 Login

**Severity:** P2 — Medium
**Type:** TECH
**Owner:** NextaBiZ Team

**Issue:**
When a NextaBiZ merchant logs in via REZ OAuth2 and does not already have a NextaBiZ account, a new merchant account is created. If they already have a NextaBiZ account with a different login method, they end up with **two merchant accounts** — one linked to REZ, one unlinked.

The linkage flow (Settings → Link REZ Account) is manual and opt-in.

**Impact:**
- Merchant data fragmentation — two profiles, two sets of products, two order histories
- Confusing UX — merchant logs in and sees an empty dashboard
- Lost business data

**Resolution Required:**
1. On first OAuth2 login, check for existing merchant account by:
   - Phone number (from REZ user info `phone` field)
   - Email (from REZ user info `email` field)
2. If found, prompt: "We found an existing NextaBiZ account. Link it to your REZ account?"
3. If not found, create new account (current behavior)
4. Add a "Merge accounts" flow for merchants who already have duplicate accounts

**Effort:** 1-2 weeks

### TECH-008: No Feature Flag System

**Severity:** P2 — Medium
**Type:** OPS + TECH
**Owner:** Platform Team

**Issue:**
No feature flag system. Features are shipped by pushing code. Rolling back a feature requires a new deployment.

**Impact:**
- No safe rollout strategy — a bad feature reaches 100% of users instantly
- No A/B testing capability
- Cannot enable features for internal users without shipping to production
- Hard to do progressive rollouts

**Resolution Required:**
1. Deploy LaunchDarkly, Unleash (self-hosted), or PostHog Feature Flags
2. Add feature flags for all new features
3. Configure rollout rules: 10% → 50% → 100% with automatic rollback if error rate spikes
4. Add flags for: beta features, enterprise-only features, experiment groups

**Effort:** 1-2 weeks (setup) + ongoing adoption

---

### BIZ-002: No Described Data Retention Policy

**Severity:** P2 — Medium
**Type:** BIZ + SEC
**Owner:** Legal / Platform Team

**Issue:**
No documented data retention policy for:
- User profile data (REZ accounts, merchant accounts, Rendez profiles)
- Transaction history (wallet transfers, bookings, orders)
- Audit logs (who accessed what, when)
- OAuth2 token logs

**Impact:**
- GDPR / data protection compliance risk
- Unnecessary database growth (storing data forever is expensive)
- No clear policy for data deletion on user request

**Resolution Required:**
1. Define retention periods:
   - Auth logs: 1 year
   - Transaction records: 7 years (financial compliance)
   - User profiles (deleted accounts): 90 days, then anonymized
   - OAuth2 token logs: 1 year
2. Implement automated deletion jobs (cron)
3. Add a "Delete my account" flow that anonymizes data
4. Document in privacy policy

**Effort:** 1-2 weeks (policy) + 2-3 weeks (implementation)

## P3 — Low / Cleanup

---

### TECH-009: NextaBiZ .env.example Has Stale Values

**Severity:** P3 — Low
**Type:** TECH
**Owner:** NextaBiZ Team

**Issue:**
`.env.example` had duplicate `REZ_AUTH_SERVICE_URL` and `REZ_INTERNAL_KEY` entries. Partially fixed — the duplicate values are removed, but some values (like `NEXT_PUBLIC_REZ_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:4002`) reference a non-existent local service.

**Status:** Mostly resolved. Minor cleanup remaining.

---

### TECH-010: Hotel Panel OAuth2 Uses Non-Standard Port

**Severity:** P3 — Low
**Type:** TECH
**Owner:** Hotel Panel Team

**Issue:**
Hotel Panel OAuth2 was configured with `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3001` but Hotel OTA backend runs on `http://localhost:3000`. The callback route and API calls need to be verified to use consistent ports.

**Status:** Needs verification. The callback handler uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` for backend calls, which is correct.

---

### TECH-011: REZ Merchant Service — 68 Barrel Export Errors

**Severity:** P3 — Low
**Type:** TECH
**Owner:** REZ Merchant Service Team

**Issue:**
`src/models/index.ts` has 68 TypeScript errors (`TS2305: Module has no exported member 'default'`). These are pre-existing barrel export issues, not introduced by recent changes.

**Status:** Unresolved. Affects DX but not runtime behavior.

---

### TECH-012: Rendez — No Auth Middleware on Some Routes

**Severity:** P3 — Low
**Type:** SEC
**Owner:** Rendez Team

**Issue:**
Not all Rendez API routes were audited for auth middleware coverage. Some routes may be accessible without a valid JWT.

**Status:** Needs a full auth coverage audit.
